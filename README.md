# YakiAI-Intelligent-Cyberthreat-Detection
An advanced machine learning project for User &amp; Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) that leverages AI to classify and detect suspicious activities in real-time, enhancing cybersecurity through data-driven insights.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
- Objective: To classify user behavior as Normal or Suspicious based on logs of activities such as logins, file access, and system changes.
- Dataset: A curated dataset capturing various user activities, timestamps, and labels for behavior classification.

## üìö Key Features
**1. Data Preprocessing:**

- Timestamp conversion and normalization.
- Categorical column encoding using `LabelEncoder`.
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.

**2. Machine Learning Models:**

- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree
- CatBoost Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


**3.Evaluation Metrics:**

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for model performance.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values for prediction reliability.

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Imported user activity logs and structured them for ML training.
2. **Data Preparation**:
- Converted timestamps to numerical formats.
- Encoded and scaled features for uniformity.
3. **Model Training:** Trained multiple algorithms on the processed dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
- Compared models based on metrics to identify the best-performing algorithm.
- Visualized predictions with scatter plots and regression lines.
5. **Insights & Improvements:**
- Optimized hyperparameters to reduce overfitting in Random Forest and CatBoost models.
