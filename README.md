# YakiAI User & Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) ML Project
An advanced machine learning project for User &amp; Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) that leverages AI to classify and detect suspicious activities in real-time, enhancing cybersecurity through data-driven insights.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
- Objective: To classify user behavior as Normal or Suspicious based on logs of activities such as logins, file access, and system changes.
- Dataset: A curated dataset capturing various user activities, timestamps, and labels for behavior classification.

## üìö Key Features

**1. Data Preprocessing:**

  - Timestamp conversion and normalization.
  - Categorical column encoding using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.

**2. Machine Learning Models:**

  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree
  - CatBoost Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


**3. Evaluation Metrics:**

  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for model performance.
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values for prediction reliability.

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Imported user activity logs and structured them for ML training.
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
  - Converted timestamps to numerical formats.
  - Encoded and scaled features for uniformity.
    
3. **Model Training:** Trained multiple algorithms on the processed dataset.
    
4. **Model Evaluation:**
  - Compared models based on metrics to identify the best-performing algorithm.
  - Visualized predictions with scatter plots and regression lines.
    
5. **Insights & Improvements:**
  - Optimized hyperparameters to reduce overfitting in Random Forest and CatBoost models.
